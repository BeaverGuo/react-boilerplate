/*d3
Is Selecting Necessary?
Later on in chapter 11 youâ€™ll see how to use D3 with MVC (model view controller) architecture. But typically, MVC
libraries like Angular or React are responsible for creating and destroying HTML elements and associating them with
certain datapoints. In those cases, you might stop using D3 to create and update elements and use it purely as a
visualization kernel for your application.
